                                The intersection of consulting and software development has become a comfort zone for me in my career.
                                On the business side, I've been exposed to client interactions and high-level discussions, led technical workshops and client
                                demos for C-Suite executives, fellow employees, and high school children, and been provided opportunities
                                for international business travel to lead &amp; implement workflows with development centers. All this,
                                while doing software development for a field I am passionate about. I've experienced immense professional
                                growth and exposure due to the fast nature of the consulting industry, and I'm excited to further hone my
                                existing technical skills, as well as venture into new ones.

                                Capital One afforded me with an environment where I fell in love with front-end development.
                                Using the MEAN stack to develop an internal web application with a fellow intern, I found the journey
                                unlike anything I had learned in school at the time. The company also did an amazing job
                                spoiling the interns in the form of consistently planned outside-of-work events, happy hours, and
                                team dinners. I learned first-hand the importance of working for an organization that takes
                                the time and energy to invest in their employees' happiness, and promotes a culture that gets
                                people excited to show up for work in the morning.

                                My first adventure in the corporate world of software development was creating
                                an autonomous defect generation tool, using Python scripts and SQL queries. This 3-month
                                internship taught me a valuable skill that I've taken to heart throughout my future
                                experience: adaptability. Having never written Python or SQL before, I learned the
                                importance of being flexible and not being scared to dive into something new. I 
                                have my supportive team of engineers at Deere to thank for being patient with me and
                                answering my endless questions on the languages used, being "agile", pair-programming, and
                                working as a software developer.

                                I am forever grateful for the opportunity to attend the University of Illinois (UIUC), and for the education
                                I received during my 4 years at the college. As important as my time was spent inside classes, it was the
                                experiences I had outside of class that have taught me valuable life lessons I carry to this day.
                                I learned the importance of teamwork and working to strive towards a single goal during my 2 years
                                as a performer for <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/IBhangra/">Illini Bhangra</a></span>. Being a part

                                exposed me to the power of working with a team from different backgrounds, both professionally and culturally.
                                Leadership experience was exposed to me in multiple aspects of my life at UIUC, but perhaps the most as a proud

                                        Mark Manson's book grabs you by the shoulders and enlightens you to question the way you've approached, or have been taught to approach life.
                                        It was a refreshing, new perspective on living life through the author's own lessons and experiences. The overarching theme of his writing seems to 
                                        advise people to concentrate your energy and time into things that are truly worth caring about, and f*ck the rest. Approach this book with an open mind, and
                                        with plenty of skepticism. It's a perfect, quick and easy read for the daily work commute.

                                        Arguably, the most life-changing book I have ever read. A beautifully written novel on the conversations between Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
                                        His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, this book taught me the difference between temporary happiness, and everlasting joy. The messages and lessons
                                        this book teaches transcends any single religion, and reaches every generation. It also teaches the reader how simple joy can be found in even the most

                                        Ever since reading the Harry Potter saga, I haven't come across a fiction novel that could keep me gripped and wanting to turn the page late into
                                        the night. Until I came across Ready Player One. A witty novel set in a future where being immersed in virtual reality is as common as owning a cell phone,
                                        Ready Player One does an amazing job of creating a fantasy universe with a fast-paced plot that keeps the reader entranced until the end. I enjoyed the futurism
                                        ideas from this novel, and after reading it, you can clearly imagine author Ernest Cline's future becoming a reality.
